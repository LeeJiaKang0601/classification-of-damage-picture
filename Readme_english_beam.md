## 2.Beam Grading Method
Classify the photos of beam into folders labeled L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 according to the level of damage, referencing the definitions provided by the National Land Management Agency, MOI.

## 3.Beam Photo Filtering Criteria
Photos that are **blurry** or **overly localized** are not accepted.

The above photos are not use for training.


## 4.Cropping Instructions

First, confirm the position of the beam in the photo, and then use cropping to place the beam in the exact center of the photo. Additionally, try to minimize the impact of other clutter on the composition of the image.

### 4.1.Cropping Requirements

- Ensure that the beam is **centered** in the photo.

- 
- Maintain a certain distance from the beam when shooting, aiming to include both the **top and bottom of the column** as much as possible.

- Strive to have the beam occupy more than **50%** of the entire picture.

- Remove background noise and avoid including other clutter in the photo.

### 4.2.Cropping Examples

#### 4.2.1.When the beam occupies a small portion of the frame.

#### 4.2.2.When encountering a situation with a lot of clutter in the frame.

#### 4.2.3.When encountering cantilever beam in the frame.

|Damage Grade|Beam Photo Count|
|---|---|
|L1|243|
|L2|75|
|L3|38|
|L4|20|
|L5|6|
|Total|382|

#### 5.Photo Shooting Recommendations

- **Ensure Centering**: Make sure the beam is centered in the frame when shooting.

- During shooting, there should be a certain distance from the beam, covering the **pillars on both sides of the beam** as much as possible, while also being able to see the upper and lower boundaries.

- Try to ensure that the beam occupies more than 50% of the entire image.

- Try to remove other clutter to avoid including them.
