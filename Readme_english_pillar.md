## 2.Column Grading Method
Classify the photos of column into folders labeled L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 according to the level of damage, referencing the definitions provided by the National Land Management Agency, MOI.

## 3.Column Photo Filtering Criteria
Photos that are **blurry** or **overly localized** are not accepted.

## 4.Cropping Instructions

First, confirm the position of the column in the photo, and then use cropping to place the column in the exact center of the photo. Additionally, try to minimize the impact of other clutter on the composition of the image.

### 4.1.Cropping Requirements

- Ensure that the entire column is **centered** in the photo.

- Maintain a certain distance from the column when shooting, aiming to include both the **top and bottom of the column** as much as possible.

- Strive to have the column occupy more than **50%** of the entire picture.

- Remove background noise and avoid including other clutter in the photo.

### 4.2.Cropping Examples

## 5.Photo Shooting Recommendations
According to professional advice, the key points for photographing columns are as follows:

- **Ensure Centering**: Make sure the column is centered in the frame when shooting.
- **Cover Top and Bottom**: It's preferable for the photo to include both the top and bottom of the column.
- **Column Proportion**: The column should occupy more than 50% of the photo.
- **Avoid Clutter**: Minimize distracting elements in the background and focus the lens on the column itself.
